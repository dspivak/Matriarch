# Matriarch

Matriarch is a high-level language of materials architecture, implemented in an open-source Python
library. Matriarch creates material architectures for protein structures and can output them as
atomic configurations, in the form of PDB (protein data bank) files. Using Matriarch, an engineer
can substitute building blocks and vary building instructions to create and study new materials.

The Matriarch language is based on the mathematical field of category theory, as discussed in the
journal article, [A python library for materials architecture](http://web.mit.edu/matriarch/);
however, no knowledge of category theory is necessary to operate the program.
